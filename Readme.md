## Problem Statement

- Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth. Biodiversity forms the web of life that we depend on for so  many things – food, water, medicine, a stable climate, economic growth, among others. Over half of global GDP is dependent on nature.

- The United Nations global report estimates that up to 1 million animal and plant species are on the verge of extinction. Additional reports state that biodiversity loss has reached “crisis proportions'' and estimate that over one third of species and ecosystems are at risk.


- The main driver of biodiversity loss is loss of habitat and climate change.

## The Solution & Idea

- The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) recognizes the importance of public education and  awareness. It emphasizes that without an awareness of the importance of biodiversity to human well-being, citizens and stakeholders are not likely to take the steps needed to mainstream biodiversity considerations into their daily lives and practices.

- We wish to raise awareness on importance of biodiversity in general, create community awareness of local biodiversity and  promote further exploration of local environments.

- To achieve this goal, we built a mobile app – Bionation that allows users to:
  - Keep up to date with Biodiversity related news.

  - Detect plants, birds, insects and other life forms in real time and learn more about them on a map.

  - Find places nearby where Biodiversity enthusiasts may have recorded relevant observations about them.

  - Explore Biodiversity hotspots.

  - Receive badges for all in-app activities.

  - Receive notifications about news events.

## Roadmap

- Integration with global Biodiversity platforms to allow users to detect and post observations.
- Integration with global Biodiversity platforms to allow users to submit and answer questions.
- Gamify all aspects of App usage and reward users with badges for all activities. Add a leaderboard section to allow users to visualize their exploration and community contributions.
- Enhance use of Gen AI to make the learning feature of the app more interactive.
- Allow users to follow locations of interest and receive notifications when observations are added to the location.
- Notify users when news articles are available.

## What's next for Bionation

 - We just really want this project to have a positive impact on people's lives! Still, we would love to make it more scalable & cross-platform so that the user interaction increases to a great extent :)
 - Multi-language support in app.
